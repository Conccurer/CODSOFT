\n**Credit Card Fraud Detection**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The project leverages Python's data science libraries to build a predictive model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

*Overview*
Credit card fraud detection is a common application of machine learning in the finance industry. The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or legitimate based on a dataset of credit card transactions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset has been anonymized and contains only numerical input variables. The key features of the dataset include:

Time: The seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
V1 to V28: The principal components obtained using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
Amount: The transaction amount.
Class: The label for the transaction, where 1 indicates fraud and 0 indicates a legitimate transaction.
The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.

Project Structure
Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file that contains the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results visualization.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project.
Dependencies
To run the notebook, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed by normalizing the features and handling class imbalance using techniques like undersampling or oversampling.
Model Selection: Various machine learning models are tested, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC-AUC curve.
Results: The best-performing model is selected based on its ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
Results
The final model achieved the following results:

Accuracy: [Insert Accuracy]
Precision: [Insert Precision]
Recall: [Insert Recall]
F1-Score: [Insert F1-Score]
ROC-AUC: [Insert ROC-AUC]
These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions with a high degree of accuracy and reliability.

Usage
To run the notebook, clone this repository and execute the Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
